The Internet of Things (IoT) involves **Internet-connected physical objects** or 'things' [IoT-technical-definition]. These objects typically integrate **sensors** for data generation, **actuators** for physical actions, and **communication technologies** for interaction [technical-definition-of-components]. The **Cloud** serves as a central component, hosting programs for data processing and instructing devices [Cloud-role].

A typical IoT system architecture comprises four main parts:

*   The **Cloud**: a collection of **servers** in **data centers** that process incoming data, instruct devices, provide **data visualizations**, and act as a **management and control system** [Cloud-functions, server-infrastructure].
*   The **app**: user-facing software for interaction with the device via the Cloud, enabling data viewing or triggering outputs [app-function].
